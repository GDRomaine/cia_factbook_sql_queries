## cia_factbook_sql_queries

In this project, I query `factbook.db`, a database storing all the information
from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), a data source compiled by
the United States Central Intelligence Agency storing information on 267 world
entities. It was provided to me by [dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/).

The motivation behind the project is to showcase my ability to perform data
analysis by querying a SQL database.

Note: throughout the project, I write with plural subject pronouns as opposed to
singular subject pronouns (e.g. "We have" vs. "I have"). Please do not make the
mistake of assuming a team of people were behind this project. I worked on this
project alone. I simply prefer this writing style for data science projects as
it feels more inclusive -- as if you and I are walking through the project
together :)
